# Patient-Pain-Characterictics-Project
Analysis to determine the trends in post-Operation pain observed by patients

##### GitHUB repo cloned from https://github.com/MSIA/Team_Uptake

## Pain: Are we similar?

The aim of the project is to explore the self reported pain data as well as various surgery and
patients related variables to analyze whether the pain experienced by patients with different
characteristics have similarities. The initial hypothesis is that demographics data, such as
age, weights and race, surgery types would have different effects on patientsâ€™ pain level.

### Few of the questions that have been attempted to answer are:

* Are there patients with different pain traits? 
* Are there groups of patients with similar pain 'habits'?
